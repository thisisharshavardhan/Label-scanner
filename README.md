# Label Scanner

Backend for Label Analyzer – extracts and analyzes ingredients from food label images to assess health impact.

This project aims to provide a robust backend system for the Label Analyzer application. It focuses on processing images of food labels, extracting ingredient information, and analyzing this data to provide insights into the health impact of the food product.

## Features

*   **Image Processing:** Extracts text from food label images.
*   **Ingredient Analysis:** Parses and analyzes the extracted ingredient list.
*   **Health Impact Assessment:** Provides an assessment of the product's health implications based on its ingredients.
*   **API Endpoints:** Offers a set of APIs for frontend applications to interact with the backend services.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Cloud Services:** Azure (mention specific services if known, e.g., Azure Computer Vision for OCR)
*   **Primary Language:** JavaScript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (specify version, e.g., v18.x or later)
*   npm or yarn
*   MongoDB instance (local or cloud-hosted)
*   Azure account and relevant service credentials (if applicable for OCR or other services)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thisisharshavardhan/Label-scanner.git
    cd Label-scanner
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary configuration (e.g., database connection string, API keys for Azure services).
    Example `env.example` (rename to `.env`):
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    AZURE_COMPUTER_VISION_KEY=your_azure_cv_key
    AZURE_COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT=your_azure_cv_endpoint
    PORT=3000
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your environment variables).

## API Endpoints

*(Details of API endpoints will be added here. For example:*

*   `POST /api/scan-label`: Upload an image of a food label for analysis.
*   `GET /api/product-info/{productId}`: Retrieve analysis results for a specific product.)*
