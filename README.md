# Label-scanner (Food Label Analyzer Backend)

## Description

This repository contains the backend service for the Food Label Analyzer (FLA) application. It is responsible for extracting and analyzing ingredients from food label images provided by the mobile app, and then assessing their potential health impact.

**This is the backend service. The Android mobile application for this project can be found at [thisisharshavardhan/FLA-App](https://github.com/thisisharshavardhan/FLA-App).**

## Features

*   **Image Processing:** (Describe how it handles images, e.g., receives image data/URLs)
*   **OCR for Ingredient Extraction:** (Mention if you use a specific OCR library/service, e.g., Tesseract.js, Google Cloud Vision API)
*   **Ingredient Analysis Logic:** (Briefly explain how it analyzes ingredients - e.g., database lookups, rule-based systems)
*   **API Endpoints:** Provides API(s) for the mobile application to:
    *   Upload/send food label images.
    *   Receive analysis results.

## Technologies Used

*   **Node.js / JavaScript:** (Assuming from `package.json` and language detection)
*   **Express.js:** (Common choice for Node.js APIs - update if different)
*   **(Any other key libraries or frameworks, e.g., for OCR, database interaction)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js and npm:** (Specify recommended versions if any, e.g., Node.js >= 18.x)
*   **(Any external services needed, e.g., API keys for an OCR service, database connection string)**

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thisisharshavardhan/Label-scanner.git
    cd Label-scanner
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Copy `.env.sample` to a new file named `.env`.
        ```bash
        cp .env.sample .env
        ```
    *   Edit the `.env` file with your actual configuration values (e.g., API keys, database URLs, port number).
4.  **Running the server:**
    *   **Development mode (if you have a script like `npm run dev` using nodemon):**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   **Production mode (or standard start):**
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    The server should now be running, typically on a port like `3000` or `8080` (check your `.env` or code).

## API Endpoints

(Document your key API endpoints here. For example:)

*   `POST /api/scan`
    *   **Description:** Submits a food label image for analysis.
    *   **Request Body:** (e.g., `multipart/form-data` with an image file, or JSON with an image URL)
    *   **Response:** JSON object with analysis results.
